            <p>Hello! My name is Wolfgang. In January 2024, I decided to cut most of my ties so that I could finally travel without distractions.</p>
            <p>Back then, I did not know how long I would be doing this. At first, I thought that it would only be a phase. I believed I would be back within a few months.
            </p>
            <p>Now, one year later, I am 30, still going around the globe without making plans and not much money. I have no idea where I might end up in a few weeks. But I am sure it will be fine.</p>
                
            <p>With this blog, I plan on creating something where family, friends or even people who do not know me can follow along. Where I am, what I do, and what I am struggling with. Furthermore, I want to create something for myself. Something I can look back on. That is why this blog is 100% real.</p>
